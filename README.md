# JATOMS

## Goal 
Provide one single source for:
* Theory and practical guidance on what OSGi is, why it exists and how to use it properly
* Questions and answers, battle stories, etc. provided by a community
* OSGi-compatible libraries (For those that don't provide proper manifests OOTB)

## Theory and Practical Guidance

* Theory lesson1 -> (optional example)
* Theory lesson2 -> (optional example)

* Text should be in markdown and drawings (if possible) being made with draw.io, so that the drawings can be versioned and easily altered in the future
* Theory lessons live within the jatoms.io site, examples in the examples repository, each example in its own branch
* Examples have to be editable in GitPod and should ideally contain proper gitpod configuration and a matching docker image file

## Community Content

* Chat
* Community-driven Blog
* Contributions to Theory and Practical Guidance section 

## OSGi-compatible libraries 

* (TODO: Github artifact repository)
